## Setup

Pryv.io is designed to be exposed by a third party SSL termination such as NGINX.

Choose your Set-up

- Discover Open Pryv.io on your local environment, this will only allow localhost apps to connect to your platform.
  - Download docker images without SSL (quick start)
  - Download docker images with SSL
  - Native installation
- Launch Pryv.io on a server exposed to the Internet with built-in SSL, this requires to have a hostname pointing to the public IP of your server.
  - Download docker images (quick start)
  - Native installation
- Launch Pryv.io on a server with an external SSL termination. You know what you are doing.
  - Download docker images
  - Native installation

### Docker

The dockerized versions are available at this link: [Download link](https://api.pryv.com/open-pryv.io/docker/dockerized-open-pryv.io.tgz).

If you wish to build the images yourself, refer to the following README: [docker/README-build.md](docker/README-build.md).

Once it is running, you can continue with the [tutorials](#dockerized).

### Native

*Prerequisites*:

- Node v12.13.1 [Node.js home page](https://nodejs.org/)
- Yarn v1 `npm install -g yarn`

The installation script has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and MacOSX.

- `yarn setup`: (see `scripts/` for details)
  - Fetch dependencies
  - Install mongodb
  - Install service mail
  - Install assets & app-web-auth3
  - Generate random alpha-numeric adminKey
- `yarn release` create distribution for release

#### Native setup with external SSL

[setup the environment](#native)

- `yarn pryv` - mail and database logs will be kept in `var-pryv/logs/local-*.log`

Each service independently - logs will be displayed on the console

- `yarn database` start mongodb
- `yarn api` start the API server on port 3000 (default)
- `yarn mail` start the mail service

#### Local native setup

[setup the environment](#native)

- `yarn local` is the equivalent of running `yarn pryv` + `yarn proxy` using `configs/rec-la.json`. This setup is useful to test Open Pryv.io locally.

- `yarn proxy` based on [rec-la](https://github.com/pryv/rec-la), it will expose the server running on http://localhost:3000 with an SSL certificate on https://my-computer.rec.la:4443 in this case you need to edit `configs/rec-la.json`.

#### Native Server setup with built-in SSL

[setup the environment](#native)

1. Run `yarn pryv` to start the API
2. Configure NGINX and certificate

You can find a NGINX configuration that you can include in your `sites-enabled/` in [configs/site.conf](configs/site.conf).

You must change `${HOSTNAME}` to match the hostname of the public URL.

##### SSL certificate

Using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/), you can generate a SSL certificate for your platform using `sudo certbot --nginx -d ${HOSTNAME}`.

To set an automatic renewal, run `crontab -e` and append the following line:

```cron
0 12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet
```

### Config

For the native installation, edit `config.json`, otherwise `docker/local/dockerized-config.json`:

```json
{
  "dnsLess": {
    "publicUrl":  "http://localhost:3000"
  },
  "http": {
    "port": 3000,
    "ip": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  "auth": {
    "adminAccessKey": "replace_me_randomstring",

## Start

At this moment you should have your application running on the public URL you defined.

### Native

- Create an account and launch the [authentication process](https://api.pryv.com/reference/#authenticate-your-app) on **App-Web-Access**: [https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/reg/service/info](https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/reg/service/info).
- The service info URL to your platform is: [https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/reg/service/info](https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/reg/service/info)

If you are using another public URL, replace `https://my-computer.rec.la:4443` by it in the link above.

### Dockerized

- Create an account and launch the [authentication process](https://api.pryv.com/reference/#authenticate-your-app) on **App-Web-Access**: [https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/reg/service/info](https://api.pryv.com/app-web-access/?pryvServiceInfoUrl=https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/reg/service/info).
- The service info URL to your platform is: [https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/reg/service/info](https://my-computer.rec.la:4443/reg/service/info)

If you are using another public URL, replace `https://my-computer.rec.la:4443` by it in the link above.

### Design your Data Model

Data in Pryv is stored in streams and events. We provide you with all necessary information to design your own data model in our [Data Modelling Guide](https://api.pryv.com/guides/data-modelling/) through a broad range of use cases and scenarios you might encounter.

### Try the API

After this process, you should have an account on your Open Pryv.io platform with a valid authorization token in the form of an API endpoint, you can try various **API requests** using **Postman** following this guide [https://api.pryv.com/open-api/](https://api.pryv.com/open-api/).

You can also try our [example apps with guides and tutorials](https://github.com/pryv/app-web-examples/).

## Options & Customization

### Authentication & Registration web app.

Open Pryv.io comes packaged with [app-web-auth3](https://github.com/pryv/app-web-auth3), the default web pages for app authentication, user registration and password reset.

During the set-up process it has been built and published in `public_html/access/`. To customize it, refer to its `README` in `app-web-auth3/`.

To use a new build, simply copy the contents of the generated files from `app-web-auth3/dist/` to `public_html/access/`

### Event types

Open Pryv.io comes with default **event types**.
The default ones are fetched at boot from the URL defined in service:eventTypes in the .json config file, set to https://api.pryv.com/event-types/flat.json.

To customize your own, clone the [Data Types repository](https://github.com/pryv/data-types) and follow the guide there.

### MongoDB data folder

By default the MongoDB data are stored in `var-pryv/mongodb-data`. If you want to modify the folder where the MongoDB data files are stored, you can modify in `scripts/setup-mongodb.bash` the variable `MONGO_DATA_FOLDER`.


### Visual assets and icons

Your platforms visuals can be customized in `public_html/assets/`, please refer to the README inside. These assets are a clone of the [assets-open-pryv.io](https://github.com/pryv/assets-open-pryv.io).

### E-Mails<a name="custom-email"></a>

Pryv.io can send e-mails at registration and password reset request.

The emails can be sent either by local sendmail (default) or SMTP. 

This service, its documentation and mail templates can be found in [`service-mail/`](service-mail/).

## Open Pryv.io Backup

The backup and restore (in case of data loss) of your Open Pryv.io platform is described in the following procedures.

[The root of your Open Pryv.io installation on each role (usually /var/pryv/${ROLE}/) will now be referred as
${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}.] 

### Backup

You should first ensure that you backup core data starting with MongoDB. 

1. **Core**
  - Run the following command to export the MongoDB data: 
` $ docker exec -t pryvio_mongodb /app/bin/mongodb/bin/mongodump -d pryv-node -o /app/backup/ `
The backup folder will be located at: `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/pryv/mongodb/backup/`.

  - Run the following command to export the InDuxDB data: 
  `$ docker exec -t pryvio_influxdb /usr/bin/influxd backup -portable /var/backups/ `
The backup folder will be located at: `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/pryv/influxdb/backup/`.

  - Backup the ${PRYV_CONF_ROOT} folder except the following:
    - `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/pryv/mongodb/data/`
    - `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/pryv/influxdb/data`
    - `${PRYV_CONF_ROOT}/pryv/core/data/previews/`

2. **Register**
- Backup the ${PRYV_CONF_ROOT} folder

3. **Static-web**
- Backup the ${PRYV_CONF_ROOT} folder

*Important notice: During the time of the backup, if user accounts are created between the core and register backup times, they won't be usable after a backup restoration. Attachments created after the MongoDB backup won't be accessible as their corresponding Pryv.io events will not be available.*

### Restore

You can restore your Open Pryv.io platform as described in the following guidelines:

1. **Core**
 - Empty the contents of the ${PRYV_CONF_ROOT} folder 
 - Copy the backed up files under the ${PRYV_CONF_ROOT} folder 
 - Start the service 
 - Restore the MongoDB files: `$ docker exec -t pryvio_mongodb /app/bin/mongodb/bin/mongorestore /app/backup/ `
 - Restore the InDuxDB files: `$ docker exec -t pryvio_influxdb /usr/bin/influxd restore -portable /pryv/backup/`

2. **Register**
  - Empty the contents of the ${PRYV_CONF_ROOT} folder
  - Copy the backed up files under the ${PRYV_CONF_ROOT} folder
  - Start the service

3. **Static-web**
 - Empty the contents of the ${PRYV_CONF_ROOT} folder
 - Copy the backed up files under the ${PRYV_CONF_ROOT} folder
 - Start the service
